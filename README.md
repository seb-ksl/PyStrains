PyStrains
=========
<<<<<<< HEAD
What?
-----
PyStrains is a simple lightweight strains library manager for research labs.
It is currently under heavy active development and its use is <b>NOT YET</b> recommended.
When v1.0 is reached, here is what it should do:<br /><br />
-Handle your "local" (personal) strains library<br />
-Make it possible to create a shared library with defined users and rights<br />
-Import your probably already pre-existing Excel strains library.

Why?
----
Because our lab needed a simple solution to create and handle a shared strains library.

How?
----
-Python 3<br />
-SQLite 3<br />
-GTK+

Who?
----
PyStrains is an open-source project coded by a microbiology PhD student on its (rare) spare time.
